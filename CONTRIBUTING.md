# Contributing to DeBEIR

Thanks for your interest in contributing! :tada:

## How do I report a bug or suggest an enhancement?

- As a first step, please search in the [existing issues](https://github.com/Ayuei/DeBEIR/issues) to check if your point has already been addressed.
- If that is not the case, go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/Ayuei/DeBEIR/issues/new/choose) of the respective type, providing the details as instructed in the template.

## How do I submit a change?

We welcome contributions via pull requests:

- Fork (or clone) the repo and create your branch from the default branch
- If you have added code that should be tested - add tests
- If any documentation updates are needed - make them
- Ensure the test suite passes and the code lints
- Submit the pull request

Once you have submitted your PR:

- Note that a PR is considered for review only if it doesn't break existing functionality/test cases
- Upon approval, PR is to be merged using the "squash and merge" option, so that the commit history remains linear and readable
